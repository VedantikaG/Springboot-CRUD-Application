<p align="justify">
The goal of the CRUD application was to develop a user-friendly platform for managing user data, providing a seamless experience for data creation, reading, updating, and deletion. It aimed to simplify database operations and ensure efficient communication between the backend and frontend.
### Diabetes Prediction Page. The project was developed using Spring Boot for the backend, where I designed RESTful APIs for seamless communication with the frontend, built using React. MySQL was utilized as the database to store user data, and Spring JPA was used to optimize queries and manage database interactions. By establishing clear integration points between the backend and frontend, I ensured a smooth data management process, allowing for real-time updates.
